## Who is it for?

SQLRooms is designed for developers building:

- Interactive data analysis tools
- Custom BI solutions
- Data visualization applications
- Internal analytics dashboards

## Motivation

Modern data analytics applications face several challenges that SQLRooms addresses:

### Developer Experience

Building analytics applications typically requires integrating multiple complex components. SQLRooms provides a complete foundation with state management, UI components, and extensible architecture out of the box.

### Performance and Scale

DuckDB is purpose-built for analytics, providing fast query performance on large datasets through its columnar engine and optimized query processing. Running in the browser through WebAssembly, each user gets their own instance, enabling automatic scaling without infrastructure costs. Applications can even work offline, as there's no dependency on backend services.

### AI-Powered Analytics

The browser-based DuckDB engine enables powerful AI-driven analytics workflows:

- Interactive AI agents that can write and execute SQL queries
- Automated data analysis and insights generation

Check out our [AI example](/examples#ai-powered-analytics) that demonstrates how to build an AI agent that can analyze your data using natural language, execute SQL queries, and provide insights â€“ all running directly in the browser.

### Privacy and Security

SQLRooms enables applications where sensitive data can remain completely client-side, as all data processing and analysis can be performed directly in the browser using DuckDB. This architecture allows for implementations where data never needs to leave the client, simplifying compliance and security requirements when needed.

## Modular Architecture

SQLRooms is designed with a modular architecture that allows developers to pick and choose exactly the functionality they need for their data analytics applications. This approach enables you to build custom solutions tailored to your specific requirements.

## Understanding the Slice-Based Architecture

SQLRooms uses a slice-based architecture powered by Zustand for state management. This approach allows you to compose different functionality slices into a unified application state.

### What is a Slice?

A slice is a modular piece of state and associated actions that can be combined with other slices to form a complete application state. Each feature package typically provides its own slice that can be integrated into your application.

For example, from the AI example application:

```typescript
// Combining multiple slices into a unified application state
export type AppState = ProjectState<AppConfig> &
  AiSliceState &
  SqlEditorSliceState &
  CustomAppState;
```

### How to Combine Slices

Slices are combined in the store creation process. Here's an example from the AI example application:

```typescript
// Creating a store with multiple slices
const useStore = create<AppState>()(
  immer((set, get, store) => ({
    // Base project state
    ...createProjectSlice<AppConfig>({
      // Project configuration
      // ...
    })(set, get, store),

    // SQL editor slice
    ...createSqlEditorSlice()(set, get, store),

    // AI slice with custom configuration
    ...createAiSlice({
      getApiKey: (modelProvider: string) => {
        return get()?.apiKeys[modelProvider] || '';
      },
      // Add custom tools
      customTools: {
        // Add the VegaChart tool from the vega package
        chart: createVegaChartTool(),

        // Example of adding a simple echo tool
        echo: {
          description: 'A simple echo tool that returns the input text',
          parameters: z.object({
            text: z.string().describe('The text to echo back'),
          }),
          execute: async ({text}: {text: string}) => {
            return {
              llmResult: {
                success: true,
                details: `Echo: ${text}`,
              },
            };
          },
          component: EchoToolResult,
        },
      },
      // Additional configuration...
    })(set, get, store),

    // Custom application state
    // ...
  })),
);
```

This approach allows you to:

1. Include only the slices you need
2. Customize each slice with your own configuration
3. Extend slices with additional functionality
4. Create custom slices for application-specific features

## Integration Examples

### Basic Integration

Here's a simple example of how to integrate SQLRooms packages in a React application:

```tsx
import {ProjectBuilder} from '@sqlrooms/project-builder';
import {SqlEditorModal} from '@sqlrooms/sql-editor';
import {useDisclosure} from '@sqlrooms/ui';

export const App = () => {
  const sqlEditor = useDisclosure();

  return (
    <div className="flex h-full w-full">
      <div className="flex h-full w-full flex-col">
        <ProjectBuilder />
      </div>
      <SqlEditorModal isOpen={sqlEditor.isOpen} onClose={sqlEditor.onClose} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Advanced Integration with Multiple Features

For more complex applications, you can combine multiple packages:

```tsx
import {
  ProjectBuilder,
  ProjectBuilderSidebarButtons,
} from '@sqlrooms/project-builder';
import {SqlEditorModal} from '@sqlrooms/sql-editor';
import {ThemeSwitch, useDisclosure} from '@sqlrooms/ui';
import {VegaVisualization} from '@sqlrooms/vega';
import {AiAssistant} from '@sqlrooms/ai';
import {FileDropzone} from '@sqlrooms/dropzone';
import {TerminalIcon} from 'lucide-react';

export const AdvancedApp = () => {
  const sqlEditor = useDisclosure();

  return (
    <div className="flex h-full w-full">
      <div className="bg-muted/50 flex h-full flex-col px-1 py-2">
        <ProjectBuilderSidebarButtons />
        <SidebarButton
          title="SQL Editor"
          onClick={sqlEditor.onToggle}
          icon={TerminalIcon}
        />
        <ThemeSwitch />
      </div>
      <div className="flex h-full w-full flex-col">
        <FileDropzone>
          <ProjectBuilder>
            <AiAssistant />
            <VegaVisualization />
          </ProjectBuilder>
        </FileDropzone>
      </div>
      <SqlEditorModal isOpen={sqlEditor.isOpen} onClose={sqlEditor.onClose} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Extending with Custom Tools and Functionality

SQLRooms allows you to extend existing slices with custom functionality. For example, you can add custom tools to the AI slice:

```typescript
...createAiSlice({
  // Configuration...
  customTools: {
    // Add the VegaChart tool from the vega package
    chart: createVegaChartTool(),

    // Example of adding a simple echo tool
    echo: {
      description: 'A simple echo tool that returns the input text',
      parameters: z.object({
        text: z.string().describe('The text to echo back'),
      }),
      execute: async ({text}: {text: string}) => {
        return {
          llmResult: {
            success: true,
            details: `Echo: ${text}`,
          },
        };
      },
      component: EchoToolResult,
    },
  },
})(set, get, store)
```

This extensibility allows you to customize the behavior of each slice to meet your specific requirements.

## Best Practices for Combining Packages

When combining SQLRooms packages, consider these best practices:

1. **Start with Core Packages**: Always begin with the core packages (`project-builder`, `project-config`, `duckdb`, and `ui`)
2. **Add Features Incrementally**: Add feature packages one at a time to ensure compatibility
3. **Consider Dependencies**: Some feature packages may have dependencies on others, so check the documentation
4. **Optimize Bundle Size**: Only include the packages you need to keep your application lightweight
5. **Version Consistency**: Use consistent versions across all SQLRooms packages to avoid compatibility issues
6. **Customize Slices**: Take advantage of the configuration options provided by each slice to customize behavior
7. **Extend with Custom State**: Add your own custom state slices to handle application-specific functionality
